## Atmospheric correction of satellite images

If you need to convert **at-sensor radiance to surface reflectance** then this repo might might be for you.

## What is a 6S emulator

[6S](http://modis-sr.ltdri.org/pages/6SCode.html) is a radiative transfer code used for atmospheric correction. We developed a 6S  emulator to run atmospheric correction 100x faster!!

## Installation

The source code and all dependencies are available in the following docker container: [DOCKER IMAGE].

## How do I use it?

Please see the examples [LINK TO EXAMPLES].
