Z_README
--------

This 'z' directory is for 'advanced' users. Its intention is to make the results more reproducible. Please see the Wiki pages for documentation on Atmcorr.

The z directory is a place to store components of the project that are not critical for usage but that can help explain how we got to where we are (e.g. harmonic_investigation) or how things work (e.g. jupyter notebooks).
